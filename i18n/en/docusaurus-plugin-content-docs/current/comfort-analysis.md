Comfort Analysis calculates the load on joints and muscles for the current pose, and shows a path toward a pose that puts less strain on the body. Open it from **Tools > IKFKController > Comfort Analysis**.

## What it calculates

- The load on each joint, using body size such as height, weight, and sex.
- The load ratio of each joint. The largest value is shown as the maximum load ratio for the pose.
- A pose that needs support to hold the body is judged "Unbearable", whatever its load ratio.

## Load levels

| Maximum load ratio | Level |
| --- | --- |
| Under 2% | Very comfortable |
| Under 5% | Comfortable |
| Under 15% | No particular problem |
| Under 30% | Mostly fine |
| Under 50% | Tolerable for a while |
| Under 100% | Barely tolerable |
| 100% or more, or support needed | Unbearable |

The level boundaries are provisional values (Assumed). The reference point is a guideline from Ergoweb: about 15% can be held for a long time, and about 50% for about 2 minutes. We use that guideline as given and treat the boundaries as assumptions.

## Posture names

Names such as standing or sitting are used only as labels in the display. They are not used to judge the pose.

## Assumptions

- The body is assumed to be upright. A strongly tilted pose is not analyzed.
- Body size comes from the values set in this Comfort Analysis window. It is not shared with the Pose Controller's assist.
